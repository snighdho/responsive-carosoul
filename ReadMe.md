# Responsive Carousel with Dot Indicators and Scaling Center Card

This project implements a responsive carousel with dot indicators, navigation buttons, and a visually larger center card for better aesthetics and user focus. The carousel is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The carousel adjusts its layout for various screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Dot Indicators**: Clickable dots allow users to navigate to specific slides.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Left and right navigation buttons for manual slide control.
- **Auto-Rotation**: Slides rotate automatically every 3 seconds (can be paused on hover).
- **Scaling Center Card**: The middle card is dynamically scaled larger than others for emphasis.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Smooth animations for both card scaling and carousel sliding.

## How It Works

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure of the carousel.
2. **CSS**: Handles styling, animations, and responsiveness.
3. **JavaScript**: Manages dynamic behavior, such as slide navigation, dot updates, and card scaling.
